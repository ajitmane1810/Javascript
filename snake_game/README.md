## Overview

This is a simple yet addictive **Snake Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game mimics the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows in length each time it eats food. The objective is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body while trying to eat as much food as possible to score points.

### **Gameplay**
- **Objective**: Control the snake and eat food to grow in length.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Score**: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food.

## Features

- **Score Tracking**: The current score is displayed on the screen and updated with each food eaten.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Arrow keys are used to move the snake in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Game Over Screen**: Once the game ends, the player's score is shown, and the game can be restarted.
